- Ported the mod to Architectury, making it fully compatible with both Fabric and Forge. (Thanks for the help @MehVahdJukaar!)
- Removed the hard dependency on Cloth Config, making it optional with YACL and Configured available as alternatives.
- Fixed the camera not moving to an upright position when landing with chat or inventory open.
