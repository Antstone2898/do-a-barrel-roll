- Updated to 1.20.
- Rewrote a massive chunk of internal code and API.
  - This should make the overall smoothness of flight more... smooth.
  - Also makes it way easier to create addon mods with similar roll mechanics.
  - And server-side roll syncing should see some improvements as well.
  - These changes are quite experimental, so please report any issues you find.
- Revamped config screen to use new YACL v3 features, and be cleaner overall.
