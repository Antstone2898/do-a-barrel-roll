- Rewrote a massive chunk of internal code and API.
    - Functionality of the mod should not be affected.
    - This should make the overall smoothness of flight more... smooth.
    - Also makes it way easier to create addon mods with similar roll mechanics.
    - And server-side roll syncing should see some improvements as well.
    - These changes are quite experimental, so please report any issues you find.
- Revamped config screen to use new YACL v3 features, and be cleaner overall.
- Changed how keybindings in flight are handled.
    - Yaw, pitch, roll and thrusting keybinds can now be set independently of vanilla controls.
    - If you set one of these to the same button as a vanilla keybind, they will override it while flying.
    - This is *also* experimental.
- Added a seperate keybind category for movement to distinguish it.
