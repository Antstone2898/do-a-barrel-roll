# Do a Barrel Roll

[](img/do-a-barrel-roll.gif)

A lightweight, clientside mod that changes elytra flight to be more fun and (kind of) realistic.
It unlocks the camera orientation, changes some controls around and adds smoothing, 
allowing for more flexible and enjoyable midair movement.

The modified controls are similar to flight sims:

- Mouse x axis to roll
- Mouse y axis to pitch
- strafe keys (normally A and D) to yaw

This mod does not actually modify the flight physics themselves, 
so in most cases it shouldn't trigger anticheat. 
However, doing things like loopings looks to the server like rapid camera movement
and may get you flagged.
**Use at your own risk.**
