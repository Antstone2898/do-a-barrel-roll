  title: §lDo a Barrel Roll
  general:
    .: General
    mod_enabled: Mod Enabled
    mod_enabled.description: > 
      Enables or disables the mod entirely. 
      Can also be toggled using %1$s ingame.
  controls:
    .: Controls
    switch_roll_and_yaw: Switch Roll and Yaw
    switch_roll_and_yaw.description: >
      Switch the roll and yaw axis while using a mouse to be more in line with vanilla movement. 
      This is not recommended for the best experience™, but might make flying easier for some people.
    momentum_based_mouse: Use Momentum Based Mouse
    momentum_based_mouse.description: > 
      Makes it easier to make continuous movements with the mouse, 
      Though it can take some getting used to.
    show_momentum_widget: Show Momentum Mouse Widget
    show_momentum_widget.description: > 
      Turn the crosshair into a helpful widget when using the momentum based mouse.
      The length of the line indicates the amount of turning power applied in a given direction.
    momentum_mouse_deadzone: Momentum Mouse Deadzone
    momentum_mouse_deadzone.description: >
      Specify a deadzone when using the momentum based mouse. 
      This can make it easier to fly straight, but higher values will make subtle adjustments more difficult.
    activation_behaviour:
      .: Activation Behaviour
      vanilla: Vanilla
      triple_jump: Triple Jump
      hybrid: Hybrid
      hybrid_toggle: Hybrid Toggle
      description:
        .: |+
          Configures how the Elytra is activated.
        

        vanilla: >
          §lVanilla§r: Same as vanilla; jump once while off the ground.
        triple_jump: >
          §lTriple Jump§r: Requires you to jump twice while off the ground instead of once. 
          Can be helpful in preventing your elytra from activating while sprint jumping.
        hybrid: >
          §lHybrid§r: Jumping once while off the ground activates standard vanilla flight, 
          jumping again after that enables the mod and unlocks the roll axis. Takes some getting used to, 
          but can be helpful when taking off in confined spaces.
        hybrid_toggle: >
          §lHybrid Toggle§r: Same as Hybrid mode, but jumping toggles the mod and roll axis instead of just 
          enabling it once, essentially letting you switch the mod on and off on the fly. (pun intended)
    invert_pitch: Invert Pitch
    invert_pitch.description: >
      Inverts the pitch axis while flying with a mouse.
  hud:
    .: HUD
    show_horizon: Show Horizon Widget
    show_horizon.description: Show a simple artificial horizon widget around your crosshair.
  banking:
    .: Banking Options
    enable_banking: Enable Banking
    enable_banking.description: > 
      Adds a slight continuous yaw and pitch to the camera based on your current roll.
      Creates a more realistic, plane-like feeling while flying, 
      allowing you to make turns without having to do full 90 degree rolls.
    banking_strength: Banking Strength
  thrust:
    .: Thrusting Options
    enable_thrust: Enable Thrusting
    enable_thrust.description: >
      Enables you to use the forward and back keys (W and S by default) 
      to infinitely accelerate and decelerate respectively.
      
      §4This feature is disabled on any server that does not explicitly allow it.
    max_thrust: Max Thrusting Speed
    max_thrust.description: >
      The maximum speed that can be reached by thrusting. 
      Setting this to anything above 2-3 might cause
      problems with chunks not loading fast enough.
    thrust_acceleration: Thrusting Acceleration
    thrust_acceleration.description: >
      The acceleration of thrusting. 
      Higher values will make it easier to reach max speed.
    thrust_particles: Show Thrusting Particles
