    switch_roll_and_yaw: Switch Roll and Yaw
    switch_roll_and_yaw.description: Switch the roll and yaw axis. not recommended, but might make flying easier for some people.
    momentum_based_mouse: Use Momentum Based Mouse
    momentum_based_mouse.description: Makes it easier to make continuous movements with the mouse. Takes some getting used to.

        §lVANILLA§r: Same as vanilla; jump in midair.
        §lTRIPLE_JUMP§r: Requires you to jump twice in midair instead of once.
        §lHYBRID§r: Jumping once in midair activates standard vanilla flight, jumping again after that enables the mod.
        §lHYBRID_TOGGLE§r: Same as HYBRID, but jumping toggles the mod instead of just enabling it once.

  thrust:
    .: Thrusting Options
    enable_thrust: Enable Thrusting
    enable_thrust.description: |
      Enables you to use the forward and back keys (W and S by default) 
      to infinitely accelerate and decelerate respectively.
      This is a very cheaty feature, and can be used to fly very fast.
      §4This is very likely to flag anti cheat on just about any server.
      Use at your own risk.
    max_thrust: Max Thrusting Speed
    max_thrust.description: |
      The maximum speed that can be reached by thrusting. 
      Setting this to anything above 2-3 might cause
      problems with chunks not loading fast enough.
    thrust_acceleration: Thrusting Acceleration
    thrust_acceleration.description: |
      The acceleration of thrusting. 
      Higher values will make it easier to reach max speed.
